## :triangular_flag_on_post: Exploring Diversity, Practicing Inclusiveness 

<img src="/etc/img/inclusive.jpeg" align=right width=450>

Somethings can be solved with smarter algorithms or the smarter use
of algorithms (where they are used to find new insights in their
users).  And somethings cannot. Looking beyond the world of mere
algorithms, here are some exercises to help you find (some) of the
things you might be missing.

  If you don't want to watch it all (59 minutes), then just go to minute 53:30
  - A year ago I was here in D.C. at a meeting, the Swedish embassy and I was on a panel and we were talking about all these problems and how horrible it was and people kept asking  maybe do this and I was like you can't do this. Oh, this will work and no, that's too simple, and it won't work because of this and we shot down every idea that anyone in the crowd had and we basically were like we're doomed.  And there was this ambassador in the back of the room, it turns out, I just figured out who it was and I told him the story and he was like that was me. Daniel Freed. And he came to the front of the room and he scolded us and said how dare you get up here and do this to us. We've had hard problems before. We had the Cold War and we were at the -- nuclear war was like something that we were in fear of everyday. And we had hard problems and no one said, oh, we can't solve it. We chipped away at the problems. We worked at it from all these different sides and eventually those problems were gone and now we have a whole new set of problems but you can't just give up. You have to, you know, you have to chip away at these problems and I agree. We're not going to solve it with one particular thing. We need to chip away at this from all sides that's why it's important to have a diverse group of researchers to look at how we build technology that's more resistant. How do we train and educate people to become more resilient and sort of interact in these places with more -- in more productive ways.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Group Exercises

- Short exercise:
  - With a group of 6 to 20  friends, play "What is  privilege" game. Ask the [questions below](#35), letting the questions make you step forward or backward [^zoom].
  - Afterwards, form a circle and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD5f8GuNuGQ).
  - Then, working clockwise around the circle, take turns to offer 2-3 sentences on your experience with the game (or say "pass" if you do not want to talk; or if what you want to say has been said before).
- Longer exercise (about a week, multiple sessions):
  - This exercise arose from  discussions with [Dr. Margaret Burnett](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/).
  - Design tests for a system using a  _cognitive walk through_.  According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_walkthrough): cognitive walkthroughs are a usability inspection method used to identify usability issues in interactive systems, focusing on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system. A cognitive walkthrough is task-specific, whereas heuristic evaluation takes a holistic view to catch problems not caught by this and other usability inspection methods. 
  - Extract _06 - CS-SE - Fall 2020 - GenderMag Exploration.docx_ from [this on-line zip](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/ICER_2021_Supplemental_Documents/14294744);
  - In a group of four or more, consider some enhancment to a digital phone app (for details, see the extracted document).
  - Follow the guidelines of the extracted document.
  - At the end, everyone write separately the tests you would propose.
  - Finally, meet up look for differences and similarities in your proposed tests. 
- Written report (about 2-3 weeks of work): meet as a group and study [five of  the standard undergraduate subjects taught in a computer science program (second year, and higher)](#classes)
  - This exercise arose from  discussions with [Dr. Angela Smith](https://angeladrsmith.com/) and [Dr. Brittany Johnson](https://cs.gmu.edu/~johnsonb/)https://cs.gmu.edu/~johnsonb/).
  - What harm could befall people based on the decisions about the systems discussed in those classes?
  - How to mitigate that potential harms?
  - How to redesign the teaching of those subjects such that more power is granted to the people using the systems discussed in those classes.
- Term project: answer the same "harm, mitigate, empower" questions but this time, go out into the community and work with some specific social group to redesign some some software that they use of a regular basis.

[^zoom]: Or, if you want to be virtual about it, run an on-line meeting where everyone touches their sternum. Move your hand up or down  (one finger width) according to your the answers.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Solo exercise

- Essay: as per the written report above, but only for one subject.
